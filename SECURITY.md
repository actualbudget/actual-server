# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We offer security support for the latest stable release of Actual and Actual Server only. To see the current stable version, visit https://actualbudget.github.io/docs/Release-Notes.

We welcome reports of vulnerabilities in unreleased builds, since we’d obviously like to fix them before they’re released!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities in Actual’s server to https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server/security/advisories/new, and any vulnerabilities in the client-side web app to https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/security/advisories/new.
