Add the `institution_id` and your name to list of possible options in the frontend
project `actual/packages/loot-design/src/components/modals/NordigenExternalMsg.js`

```jsx
<Strong>Choose your banks:</Strong>
<CustomSelect
  options={[
    ['default', 'Choose your bank'],
    ['ING_PL_INGBPLPW', 'ING PL'],
    ['MBANK_RETAIL_BREXPLPW', 'MBANK'],
    ['SANDBOXFINANCE_SFIN0000', 'DEMO - TEST']
  ]}
```

Launch frontend and backend server

Create new linked account selecting the institution which you added recently.

In the server logs you can find all required information to create class for
your bank.

Create new a bank class based on `app-nordigen/banks/sandboxfinance-sfin0000.js`. Name of the file and class should be
created based on the ID of the integrated institution.

Fill the logic of `normalizeAccount`, `sortTransactions`, and `calculateStartingBalance` functions.
You should do it based on the data which you found in the logs.
